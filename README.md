# PBUG

This project contains a Puppet module that automates the application of
debugging configurations to Puppet and Puppet Enterprise services. Examples
of such configurations include:

  - Downloading and configuring [Java agent] libraries that add monitoring,
    profiling, or debugging capabilities.

## Requirements

This module is compatible with Puppet 4.10 and newer, which translates to
PE 2016.4 and newer. Older versions of PE may work, but have not been tested.


## Usage

Coming soon.
