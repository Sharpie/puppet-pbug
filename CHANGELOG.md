## [Release 0.2.0] - 2021-03-09

First release with support for 2019.8.0

### New Features

  - A `pbug::mitmproxy` class that automates the setup of mitmproxy.org as
    a transparent proxy for intercepting local HTTPS traffic generated by
    PE services.

### Removals

 - Everything that was in 0.1.0. That content was untested and most of it
   relied on configurations that don't apply to PE 2019.8. Bits and pieces
   may return in future versions.


## [Release 0.1.0] - 2021-03-08

Initial release. This version is tagged, but was intentionally not released to
the Puppet Forge as it contains a lot of untested configurations that broke
with the move to Java 11 in PE 2019.

Future releases will remove most of this content and start from a tested base.
